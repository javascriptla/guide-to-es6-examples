## Getting Started & Basic Qualifications (Read This Especially if You’re Newbie!)

- Working computer, mouse and keyboard (just getting the obvious out of the way)
- Mac, Windows or Linux (whatever you like)
  - Please be sure you know how to use your own computer (you’re probably reading the wrong book if you still need to ask your kids to help you open up an application).
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (meaning you know how to create variables, use if/else statements, loops, write functions and have used a little bit of object oriented programming).


## Common Notations & Syntax

If something is really important (like a title or a heading), I’ll **bold** the font like so, and would expect you to either highlight or take your own notes.

*Stuff in italic* is for stuff I’m emphasizing, for example a step to follow

Anything following two slashes `//` or sitting between the notations `/* */` can be thought of as comments, or basically what we’d expect to see if we executed some code block.  Long lines of comments will use the  `/* */` syntax.


## Setting Up Your Computer

Here are my minimum requirements for this course, and for us to be successful together.


**Download & Install The Following**

- Chrome or Firefox.
  - <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
  - <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/>
  - You can use Edge or Safari, or some other browser too but the tools from those browsers may not be adequate if you are following along.
- Sublime Text, Atom Editor or Visual Studio Code.
  - <https://www.sublimetext.com/>
  - <https://atom.io/>
  - <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
  - Visual Studio Code tends to be fancier and what all the cool kids are using, however my favorite tends to be Atom because it’s dead simple to use, and very lightweight.
- Node.js
  - Download via: <https://nodejs.org/>
  - At the time of writing, the latest stable version is 8.11.3.
  - While Node.js isn’t necessary to have for learning ES6, almost every company these days requires you to have some working knowledge of the technology.   We’re not going to learn Node in this book, but we will cover the basics so you can try out the code samples on your own.
- Terminal App (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
  - (Technically you don’t need to download this, you just need to find it.)
    Here’s a helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sju1P_N1P_U) if you can’t find it, and / or want to know what a terminal is.
- Optional (Git, Github Desktop)
  - Examples will be available on Github if you’d like to browse.
    Note: You’ll need to have familiarity with Git/Github (not covered in this book).
